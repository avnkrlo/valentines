                                First of all, I would like to wish you a Happy Valentine's Day. It has been 109 days(including today) since we started to press the "Like" button for each other riskily. At first I never really thought that we would be in this position as we are now, I never really thought that our love, affection, and understanding for each other would be this deep in that short amount of time, although it already feels like we knew each other way before and just decided to take a huge risk.
                                
                                I never really thought that meeting and knowing you would be the biggest change of my life. You pushed me out of my comfort zone, you never missed a day without complimenting me, telling me how you truly felt towards me, and making sure I drank enough water for the day.
                                
                                A short amount of time and so many things had already happened between us that I'm sure made us more connected and strengthened the bond we're trying to build. I may not be the perfect boyfriend for you but I promise you that I will be the last and bestest boyfriend you'll ever have. I'll do my best to show and tell you how much I love every inch of you from the bottom of my heart and the deepest part of my soul.
                                
                                This may not be that much of a gift for our Valentine's but I can't do much when we're so far away from each other, If only I could teleport wherever you may be. ðŸ¥² I know I'm not that good at showing how much I love and adore you sometimes or maybe most of the time but I'm never going to lie about how I truly felt towards you and in our relationship. I do wish, oh not just wish, I do want to do everything I can so I can keep what we have right now to last until I can and able to marry you and give you the life you wanted.
                                
                                This is just a short letter of how I truly adore and appreciate your existence and how unexpectedly you came into my life. I want to say a lot more things about how I truly felt about you but I guess I'm gonna hold back for now and cherish the times we will spend soon together. ILOVEYOOOOOOOOUUUUUUSOSOVERYVERYMUCH MY BABY!!ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’•ðŸ’•
                                
                                NEVER EVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS PRETTY AND CUTE AS A BABY, MY BABY!! ðŸ¥°ðŸ’•
                                
                                Regards,
                                Your one and only handsome Baby, Aivan
